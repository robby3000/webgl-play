Okay, I have fetched and reviewed the content of the blog post "A flowing WebGL gradient, deconstructed" by Alex Harri. It's an excellent breakdown and closely matches the structure and techniques used in your `src/play.ts` shader code.

Based on the blog post and the existing code, here are some suggestions for control tools (sliders, switches, color pickers) that would allow you to modify the animated gradient effects in interesting ways. These map directly to parameters or concepts discussed in the post and present in your code:

**1. Core Animation & Appearance:**

*   **Overall Speed:** (Slider) Control the master speed of all animations (`u_time` multiplier). This affects waves, background noise, and blur evolution.
*   **Gradient Colors:** (Color Pickers / Presets) Allow changing the gradient lookup.
    *   Option A: Define 3-5 key colors with color pickers, and regenerate the `u_gradient` texture in JavaScript.
    *   Option B: Provide presets (like the ones shown in the blog post) that load different pre-generated gradient textures.

**2. Wave Controls (Could have separate controls for Wave 1 & Wave 2):**

*   **Wave Y Position:** (Sliders) Controls the vertical position of each wave (`WAVE1_Y`, `WAVE2_Y` constants).
*   **Wave Amplitude:** (Sliders) Controls the height/intensity of each wave (`WAVE1_HEIGHT`, `WAVE2_HEIGHT` constants).
*   **Wave Shape Scale:** (Slider) Controls the horizontal scale/frequency of the noise shaping the waves (`L` constant(s) in `wave_y_noise`). Smaller values = larger features, larger values = smaller features.
*   **Wave Shape Speed:** (Slider) Controls how fast the wave shape itself changes (`S` constant in `wave_y_noise`).
*   **Wave Flow Speed:** (Slider) Controls the horizontal drift speed of the waves (`F` constant in `wave_y_noise`).

**3. Background Noise Controls:**

*   **Noise Pattern Scale:** (Sliders) Controls the size/zoom level of the different noise layers (`L1`, `L2`, `L3` constants in `background_noise`).
*   **Noise Vertical Stretch:** (Slider) Controls the vertical stretching of the noise (`Y_SCALE` constant in `background_noise`).
*   **Noise Swirl Speed:** (Sliders) Controls the speed of the time evolution for each noise layer (`S` constant in `background_noise`).
*   **Noise Flow Speed:** (Sliders) Controls the horizontal drift speed for each noise layer (`F` multiplier constants in `background_noise`).

**4. Blur Controls:**

*   **Blur Amount:** (Slider) Controls the maximum blur radius (`blurAmount` currently passed as an option).
*   **Blur Sharpness/Bias:** (Sliders) Control the `blurExponentRange` (currently passed as an option) to adjust how sharp or soft the blur appears and how it transitions.
*   **Dynamic Blur Pattern:** (Sliders) Control the scale (`L`) and speed (`S`, `F`) of the noise used in `calc_blur` to change how the blur varies across the wave.
*   **Blur Pulsing Speed:** (Slider) Control the speed of the overall blur bias oscillation (`S` in `calc_blur_bias`).

**5. Randomization:**

*   **Randomize Seeds/Offsets:** (Button) Randomize the various offset values used in the noise functions (`wave_y_noise`, `background_noise`, `calc_blur`). This is a great way to get unpredictable new patterns.
*   **Randomize Parameters:** (Button) Randomize multiple parameters like scales, speeds, and amplitudes within certain bounds for completely new effects.

**Implementation Approach:**

1.  **Modify `src/play.ts`:** Introduce new `uniform` variables (e.g., `uniform float u_wave1_y_factor;`, `uniform float u_noise_scale_L1;`, etc.) for each parameter you want to control. Replace the corresponding hardcoded constants in the GLSL code with these uniforms.
2.  **Update `src/App.tsx`:**
    *   Use `React.useState` to manage the state for each control value (slider positions, color values).
    *   Add the UI elements (sliders, buttons, color inputs) within the `#control-section` div. Connect their `onChange` or `onClick` handlers to update the corresponding React state variables.
    *   Inside the `useEffect` where the WebGL context is set up, get the locations of all the new uniforms using `gl.getUniformLocation`.
    *   In the `render` function (the one called by `requestAnimationFrame`), before `gl.drawArrays`, update all the uniforms using the appropriate `gl.uniform*` functions based on the current values stored in the React state.
    *   For gradient changes, you'll need logic to generate a new gradient on a temporary canvas and update the `u_gradient` texture using `gl.texImage2D` whenever the color state changes.

This approach allows for interactive control over many aspects of the shader, leveraging the detailed breakdown provided in the blog post. Would you like me to start implementing some of these controls, perhaps beginning with the overall speed and wave positions?
